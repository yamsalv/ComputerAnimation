			-----	IDEA	-----

The idea of my animation would be inspired from the types of movies that i like which are thrillers or suspense.

It will be about a scuba dive I did on which it was the first time I saw a shark. The feelings I want to transmit
are excitement and fear at the same time.
Even though it was a nurse shark which isn't an aggressive type of shark at all.

Also showing the beauty of the coral reef which leaves you a huge feeling of happiness and a sense of "how
impressive was that!" after the dive is done.

I would also like to transmit the way in which divers communicate underwater without words because i think a lot
of people who don't scuba dive have questions about that.

In general I just want to share the amazing feeling you get when you're in the presence of such a beauty of the 
endless sea and the gracefulness of the animals.

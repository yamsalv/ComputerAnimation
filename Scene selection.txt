The scene I chose is the one I considered to be the most representative of what the whole short would try to convey.
This is the scene where the dive group is close to the coral reef looking at it and admiring its beauty with a close-up
to one of the main charachters which is Edgar.
So we have Edgar peacefully diving and taking in the beauty of the coral reef's scenery and just then from the back of
the coral reef comes out a medium sized octopus and in the camera view we see Edgar following approaching the octopus
and pointing at it because he is amazed by it.
What this scene is intended to portray is the greatness of the marine life, starting with the stunning view of the
coral reef and then the so very graceful actions of the turtle, a moment that in reality only lasted seconds but can
stay forevermore in a divers memory.
This scene tries to make the viewer feel calm and thankful and lucky to be allowed to witness one of the so many
wonders of nature and to make the viewer almost question their own contributions to this world which we're all part of.

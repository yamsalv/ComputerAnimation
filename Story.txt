			----- STEPS OF THE STORY -----
			
1.-	There is a group of about 6 divers on the "parked" boat getting ready their equipment and putting it on.

2.-	They jump to the water and they're floating on the surface, they agree that they're ready and they start
	to submerge.

3.-	The colours of the scene start changing from blue ocean water to all the colours of the rainbow from the
	coral reef.

4.-	Among the coral reef the group starts to spot the different animals and they start to identify the kinds
	of fish there are but then they get to see a great eagle ray from afar as it gets away.

5.-	At the very moment they're distracted, here comes the nurse shark which makes a curious turn around the
	instructor before swimming away.

6.-	Sadly, it's moment for the immersion to end and they agree to go up. The animation ends when they're on
	the surface again, smiling and speaking excitedly about what just happened.

himself and is caring of others, he shows this off by always being aware of the needs of others and he is very skilled in his rescueing
abilities. He is charming in his own way as he does not like to draw attention to himself.


GABY
Gaby is the most unnexperieced diver of the group, this is not to say she is a bad diver at all but it does show that she needs quite some
polishing and perfecting of her diving technique. She likes diving and she is compromised in improving herself, she is good friends with
the others on the group and all she needs is some practising.
